/**
* The function represents the Landau distribution.
* This class represents a Landau distribution, as 
* approximated by the Moyal formula
* \[ Moyal(\lambda) = \frac{\exp{-0.5(\lambda+\exp{-\lambda})}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \]
* See J.E. Moyal, Theory of ionization fluctuations, Phil. Mag. 46 (1955) 263.
* Note that this analytical approximation is too low in the tail.
* In order to allow for a fit, we define
* \[ \lambda = \frac{x - m}{s} \]
* with x the dataset variable.
